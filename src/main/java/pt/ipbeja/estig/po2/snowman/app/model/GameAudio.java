/**
 * The GameAudio class is responsible for managing and playing background audio in the Snowman game.
 * It leverages the Java Sound API to handle audio playback, including looping and resource management.
 * <p>
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Playing audio files stored in the application resources
 * - Managing audio playback (start, stop, and looping)
 * - Handling audio resources efficiently
 * <p>
 * Limitations:
 * - Supports only audio files in the WAV format
 * - Cannot play multiple audio tracks simultaneously
 * - No volume control functionality
 * <p>
 * Threading Note:
 * This class is not designed for concurrent use. Ensure that method invocations occur on the same thread.

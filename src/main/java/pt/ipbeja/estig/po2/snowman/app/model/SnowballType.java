/**
 * The SnowballType enum represents the various sizes and states that a snowball can achieve
 * in the Snowman game. It is used to define the type or size of a snowball, which determines
 * its interactions with other game elements and its ability to grow or combine.
 * <p>
 * Enum Constants:
 * - SMALL: Represents the smallest size of a snowball.
 * - MID: Represents a medium-sized snowball.
 * - BIG: Represents the largest size of an individual snowball.
 * - MID_SMALL: Represents a combination of a medium and small snowball.
 * - BIG_SMALL: Represents a combination of a large and small snowball.
 * - BIG_MID: Represents a combination of a large and medium snowball.
 * - COMPLETE: Represents a complete snowman formed by combining all necessary parts.
 * <p>
 * Usage:
 * - This enum is used in the game logic to track and manage the state of snowballs.
 * - The combination logic depends on the type of snowballs involved, leading to either
 * larger snowballs or the formation of a complete snowman.
 * <p>
 * Key Features:
 * - Provides a clear and extensible representation of snowball states.
 * - Facilitates logic for snowball growth and combination.

/**
 * The View interface defines a contract for classes responsible for presenting
 * the game's board state to the user and updating the visual representation when changes occur.
 * <p>
 * This interface is typically implemented by classes that handle the graphical or textual
 * display of the game board. It separates the view logic from the model, adhering to the
 * Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
 * <p>
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Ensure the game board's visual representation remains in sync with the underlying model's state.
 * - Provide an implementation for dynamically updating the board when the game state changes.
 * <p>
 * Methods:
 * - {@link #updateBoard()}: Triggered whenever the board's state changes, forcing
 * the implementing class to refresh the display.
 * <p>
 * Usage:
 * - Classes implementing this interface should be observers of the game's model,
 * ensuring that updates to the model propagate to the view in real-time.
